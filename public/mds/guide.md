## The server
This is a geopolitical sandbox.
The main currency of the server is gold. The lowest currency is a gold nugget, highest - gold block.

## Towny
### Basics
Towny is a plugin for minecraft servers that allows players to create their own towns and nations.
Every player can be townless, or be a part of a town. To join an open town you can execute:
```
/t join <Town Name>
/t - The base command of the towny plugin. By using sub commands you can do everything related to towns.
join - Sub command that allows you to join a town. You will be able to do so, only if the town is open.
<TownName> - Name of the town you want to join.
```

You can always leave the town by executing: `/t leave`

If you don't know what town to join, you can see the list of all towns by typing: `/t list`

You can see the list of residenses of you rtown by using: `/t reslist`

By typing `/t` you will be able to see more info about the town.

You can join the channel of your town by typing `/ch join town` (that's one more of the base commands of the towny plugin).

In the town channel you can ask for a town tour. Usually players like to show others their town. Also they can teach you some basics
of the server, give you a town plot (your home), and invite you to the discord of the town/nation.

### Nations
Nation is a collection of towns. towns can join it and leave.
If your town is in a nation you can see information about it by typing `/n` (Another fundamental command of the plugin).

### SiegeWar
SiegeWar is an addiction to the Towny pluign which allows towns and nations to have war between them.
