# Rules
BY JOINING THE SERVER YOU ACCEPT THE [EULA](/eula).

## 1. Punishments
Breaking any of the rules will result in a punishment to the player's account. This might be:
* Strike;
* Temporary ban;
* Permanent ban.

3 strikes equal a temporary ban.

Punishments are written under every rule. If there is no punishment written under the rule, punishment of the block of rules is applied. Punishments can be modified depending on the context by the administrators. The length of a temporary ban is appointed by the administrators.

Administrators can punish a player without a warning, by any kind of punishment, even if the player didn't break any of the rules written here, if necessary. Please note that administrators are not allowed to abuse this rule. In any case of you being punished without a reason, please contact any of the owners.

Also, you must tell the administrators about any players breaking the rules.

## 2. Advantage over other players
These rules are about players having any kind of advantage over other players.
These rules do not apply to the [allowed mods](/mods). You can use these mods freely.

Punishment for these rules can be a strike, a temporary, or permanent ban.

### 2.1 Cheating
Any kind of client modification, macros, and any other modifications of the original game that give the player an advantage over other players are considered cheating and not allowed.

### 2.2 Using bugs and exploits of the server
If you find any bug or exploit on the server, you must immediately tell administrators and cannot use it to your advantage.
(Hint: if something seems too good to be true, probably that is a bug).

### 2.3 Alternative accounts or 'alts'
One person can have only one account on the server. Any alternative accounts of a person will be permanently banned.
(Hint: do not log on to the server under another account if your 'main' was banned).

### 2.4 Intentionally causing lag or disrupting our services
Players intentionally causing lag or any other type of disruption to the services we provide will be banned.

## 3. Behavior, names, and chatting
Any names (towns, nations, nicknames, etc.) cannot be toxic, sexual, or inappropriate. Also, any names cannot cause harm to anybody or offend anybody.

Punishment for breaking these rules might be a strike, a temporary, or permanent ban.

### 3.1 Names of places
Any place (chunk, town, nation, etc.) must have an appropriate name.
This must be a real place or a real place that existed in the past.

### 3.2 Behavior
You cannot do anything harmful to any other players if that is not by role play.

### 3.3 AFK
AFK is allowed only when server TPS is above 17.5.

### 3.4 Advertising
You cannot advertise anything not related to the server.

### 3.5 Selling anything for real money
You cannot sell/buy anything for real-world money.

### 3.6 Language
You can speak only English in the global chat. Any other language is allowed in local chats (town chat, nation chat, direct messages, etc.).

## 4. Causing damage to the world (Griefing)
You are not allowed to destroy the land anywhere. Examples of griefing:
* Digging large holes;
* Building cobblestone structures using a bucket of lava and water;
* Craters
* Walls of lava or water.
* Obsidian structures

Punishments can be a strike, temporary, or permanent ban. Also, we will rollback all the damage.

### 4.1 Griefing in wilderness
Players are not allowed to destroy land in the wilderness.

### 4.2 Claim block
Towns must be free to claim land around them. You cannot claim land right next to another town if the town you are claiming next to did not agree to that.
Punishment can be a strike. Also, we will unclaim chunks of your town without giving your gold back. Your town might be removed if its only purpose is to claim block.

### 4.3 Terraforming
Terraforming is not allowed if it changes the look of the [dynamic map](https://map.globemc.org).
Also, it is not allowed if it changes the whole look of the world map (for example - removing a mountain).

You can still build structures to support your towns (for example, build a town on a small island, and make everything outside of the land supported by any structures). Please make sure that looks good.

### 4.4 Map arts
You can create map art only in the Antarctica region. And remove them after you created the map. You can keep them if you constantly change them (for example, newspaper).
